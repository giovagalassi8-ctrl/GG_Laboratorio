# Genome Assembly

This section describes the genome assembly process. A genome assembly is a computational representation of a genomic sequence.

∎[Contig-level assembly](./00_Assembly_raw): Generation of contigs and the subsequent creation of the consensus sequence.

∎[Polishing](./01_polishing): Removal of artifacts and errors accumulated during previous stages, utilizing both short and long reads for correction.

∎[Contaminants detection](./02_contaminants): Identification and removal of assembly sequences associated with non-target organisms.

∎[Reference-based scaffolding](./03_scaffolding): Integration of the resulting contigs into scaffolds.
