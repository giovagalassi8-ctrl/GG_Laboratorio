# Ortholgy inference and Phylogenomic

This represents the comparative analysis proper, where the functional portion of the genome and selective pressures are examined to link specific evolutionary patterns to corresponding phenotypic patterns.
The analysis aims to identify genes that exhibit similar selective pressures across species sharing the same phenotype.

To perform the comparison, it is essential to have a comprehensive genomic dataset, in this case provided in the [mosquitoes.tsv](../00_practice/00_dataset/mosquitoes.tsv) file.

To retrieve the genomes selected for the comparative analysis, a dedicated script was developed, named [download_dataset.sh]
