# Comparative Genomics Laboratory

This repository represents the pipeline developed for the the comparative genomics course of Unibo. Here, we focus our attention on the mosquito family, Culicidae, many of which are vectors of disease pathogens (including well-known malaria) that have afflicted humans for centuries .

The repository contains:

- [01_Environment_list](./01_Environment_list): list of all environments used.
- [02_KmerBased_GenomeSurvey](./02_KmerBased_GenomeSurvery):  how to assess the quality of sequencer outputs.
- [03_Genome_assembly](./03_Genome_assembly): how to assembly a genome.
- [04_Genome_annotation](./04_Genome_annotation): 
- [05_OG.Inference_Phylogenomic](./05_OG.Inference_Phylogenomic):
- [06_DivergenceTime_Estimation](./06_DivergenceTime_Estimation):
- [07_GeneFamilies_Evolution](./07_GeneFamilies_Evolution):

All the folders contain the scripts and the main input files needed to perfomed the passages described in the respective README files.
